# reviews_collector_WebScrapper

We often need to collect a lot of data at our initial stages to work for other parts of the project.
this is a web crawler for www.yelp.com
it collects reviews of restaurants  near new york,
nowadays, the websites often are dynamic in nature for which you must automate the task required.

# tools used
1. python-programming language
2. selenium - to automate the tasks
3. beautiful soup- to parse the response code

# setting up things for project
1. you need to install all the libraries used with their dependencies. you can use pip installer for that.
just type:
pip install selenium
pip install bs4
etc

2. you need to download the chrome driver for selenium to work and paste the path in the  source code.


Note: please not that this code is just for restuarants in newyork so if you want to scrap data for other things in the website you need to edit the loop in the given code which takes care of hotel_urls.
